Pencils_API
By TJ Hooker

This API is intended to hit a MongoDB backend and provide back data on vintage and current woodcased pencils. Currently the data will be limited to Pencil Manufacturers/Companies and pencil model names and numbers. 

My intention is to expand this API to provide more information back to the user such as Country, date span, variants, images, historical information, and credits.
